Improvements from the initial Gila Challenge project

- Use of [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for component style
- Better componentization
- Forcing the node version to run the project properly
- Responsivity

As a future improvemente, few tests could be implemented to cover UI render and API requests.
